Network solutions are an efficient way to help protect large or complex facilities, allowing, for example, panels to communicate on the evacuation of a specific block of floors versus an entire building.

Networking helps improve survivability; if a single panel loses communication, all remaining panels can still communicate with each other. Our solutions also offer client server capability, creating the ability to monitor activity and remotely view information from a PC with the appropriate software. Additional Benefits:A single system view can deliver better command and control—ideal for large campuses and facilitiesEach panel maintains the status and control of its own points; each can also monitor and control points physically connected to other network panelsMultiple Network Loops are available for campus and other high panel quantity applicationsNetwork-wide initiation of alarm silence, acknowledge, and reset; and investigation of status and details of system points and point listsDistributed system operation to ensure excellent continuityCommand center that provides centralized network annunciation, historical logging, report generation, and control of fire alarm network points How do Network Solutions help?SaferRespond to life-safety events with speed and efficiency.SmarterNetworking allows nodes to operate together or independently.FlexibleNetworking can help protect simple locations or complex facilities.We make it easier to find the right choices for your applications.Solution PortfolioUnify multiple systems in your facility to create a true smart buildingFlexible technologies to help you configure and manage your systemCommand and control end points for sharing information and to support centralized controlFire Detection ServicesAll-inclusive personalized service offering a premium level of ongoing support where life-safety and compliance is critical for operation.A modified service tailored to meet specific or unique requirements for the critical elements of your business.A cost-effective and forward-looking service focusing on compliance and incident prevention, along with contingency plans for emergencies.For organizations where staying compliant is critical, our code and compliance experts will help you always stay up-to-date.Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detection SolutionsProtecting Your People and Property Doesn’t Have to Include Frequent Nuisance DisruptionsAddressable Our networked devices offer innovative and time-saving benefits. Cost-effective Carbon monoxide sensors are included in our smoke detectors, saving expense and extra wiring needs. Stability Rapid response times with minimal chance of nuisance alarms. Benefits of Smoke and Carbon Monoxide DetectionOur innovative software and electronics means we can offer stable smoke and carbon monoxide detectors with the quickest response time and less nuisance.
